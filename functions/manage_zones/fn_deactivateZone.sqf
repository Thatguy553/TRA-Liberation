/*
	Takes the trigger and marker for the zone to be deactivated.

	While loop checks if the time since deactivation started (_timerStart) exceeds the max inactive time allowed (TRA_zoneInactiveTime),
	breaks loop when time is exceeded or zone is reactivated. Does a check after loop is broken to see if zone is reactivated, 
	if not then all infantry, vehicles, and structures created during zone activation are deleted.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function: TRA_fnc_deactivateZone

Description:
    Function takes in the trigger for the zone to be deactivated as well as the marker for said zone.
	The function will wait TRA_zoneInactiveTime seconds before it begins deactivating. If in this time the zone is reactivated via
	player re-entering the trigger, the Deactivation is aborted. If a player does not re enter the trigger all units spawned for that
	zone will be deleted, removed from the TRA_activeAi count, and removed from TRA_zonesActive.

Parameters:
    _trigger - Trigger Object
	_marker - marker name

Returns:
    Boolean

Examples:
    (begin example)
	[_trigger, "zone_marker"] call TRA_fnc_resourceCheck;
    (end)
